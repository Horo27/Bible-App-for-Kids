A long time ago, there was a young man named David. He was kind, brave, and loved God very much.

King Saul was the ruler at that time, but he was very jealous of David. He thought David might take his place as king, so Saul tried to catch David and hurt him.

David had to hide in caves and run away to stay safe. One day, David and his friends were hiding in a big cave. Guess who walked in? King Saul! He didn’t know David was there.

David’s friends whispered, “Now’s your chance! You can stop Saul!” But David said, “No. I won’t hurt the king. God made him king, and I will respect that.”

Instead of hurting Saul, David quietly cut off a small piece of Saul’s robe. Later, David called out to him and said, “Look! I could have hurt you, but I didn’t. I don’t want to fight you. I want peace.”

Saul was surprised. He saw that David was kind and good. He said, “You are a better man than I am. Thank you for showing me mercy.”

David forgave Saul, even when Saul had been mean to him. David chose kindness instead of revenge.
