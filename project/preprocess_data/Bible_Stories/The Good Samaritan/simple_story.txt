A man was walking down a road from one city to another. On the way, some robbers attacked him!
They stole his things, hurt him badly, and left him lying on the road.

Soon, a priest came walking by. He saw the hurt man…
but instead of helping, he walked on the other side of the road and left.

Then a Levite (another religious man) came by. He saw the man too,
but he also didn’t stop to help. He just walked away.

Finally, a Samaritan man came along.
Now, Samaritans and Jews usually didn’t get along.
But when the Samaritan saw the hurt man, he felt sorry for him.

He stopped, cleaned the man’s wounds, and bandaged him.
Then he put the man on his own donkey, took him to an inn (like a hotel), and took care of him.

The next day, the Samaritan gave money to the innkeeper and said,
“Please take care of this man. I’ll come back and pay more if you need it.”
